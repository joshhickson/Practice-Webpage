<h2 id="flexbox">FlexBox</h2>
<h3> Intro</h3>
<p class="description">
FlexBox: Short for flexible box, is a CSS module; not a single property. This means it can make <a href="css-containers.html" class="button">containers</a> alter items' width / height / order to fill space. It can be used to accomadate different screen resolutions, and is even direction-agnostic, which means it's not limited to block (vertical) or inline (horizontal) positioning. Because of these features, flexbox is best used for application components and layouts that need to accomadate smaller scales.
</p>

<h3>Layout</h3>

          <p>In this layout, we display the areas in source order for any screen less that 500 pixels wide. We go to a two column layout, and then to a three column layout by redefining the grid, and the placement of items on the grid.</p>

LAYOUT

Items will be laid out following either the main axis (from main-start to main-end) or the cross axis (from cross-start to cross-end):

    main axis:
The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flex-direction property (see below).


    main-start | main-end:
The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end.


    main size:
 A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size. The flex item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’ property, whichever is in the main dimension.


    cross axis:
The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.


    cross-start | cross-end:
Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.


    cross size:
The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. The cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in the cross dimension.

FLEXBOX PROPERTIES

PARENT:
______________________________________________________
display:
This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children. Note that CSS columns have no effect on a flex container.

.container {
  display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
}
____________________________________

flex-direction:
This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.

.container {
  flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
}
    row (default): left to right in ltr; right to left in rtl
    row-reverse: right to left in ltr; left to right in rtl
    column: same as row but top to bottom
    column-reverse: same as row-reverse but bottom to top
____________________________________

flex-wrap:
By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.

.container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
}
    nowrap (default): all flex items will be on one line
    wrap: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.
    wrap-reverse: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top.
____________________________________

flex-flow:
This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex container’s main and cross axes. The default value is row nowrap.

.container {
  flex-flow: column wrap;
}

____________________________________

justify-content:

.container {
  justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | start | end | left | right ... + safe | unsafe;
}

    flex-start (default): items are packed toward the start of the flex-direction.
    flex-end: items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction.
    start: items are packed toward the start of the writing-mode direction.
    end: items are packed toward the end of the writing-mode direction.
    left: items are packed toward left edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like start.
    right: items are packed toward right edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like end.
    center: items are centered along the line
    space-between: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
    space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.
    space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.

Note that that browser support for these values is nuanced. For example, space-between never got support from some versions of Edge, and start/end/left/right aren’t in Chrome yet. MDN has detailed charts. The safest values are flex-start, flex-end, and center.

There are also two additional keywords you can pair with these values: safe and unsafe. Using safe ensures that however you do this type of positioning, you can’t push an element such that it renders off-screen (e.g. off the top) in such a way the content can’t be scrolled too (called “data loss”).
____________________________________

align-items:
This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).

.container {
  align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | first baseline | last baseline | start | end | self-start | self-end + ... safe | unsafe;
}

    stretch (default): stretch to fill the container (still respect min-width/max-width)
    flex-start / start / self-start: items are placed at the start of the cross axis. The difference between these is subtle, and is about respecting the flex-direction rules or the writing-mode rules.
    flex-end / end / self-end: items are placed at the end of the cross axis. The difference again is subtle and is about respecting flex-direction rules vs. writing-mode rules.
    center: items are centered in the cross-axis
    baseline: items are aligned such as their baselines align

The safe and unsafe modifier keywords can be used in conjunction with all the rest of these keywords (although note browser support), and deal with helping you prevent aligning elements such that the content becomes inaccessible.
____________________________________

align-content:
This aligns a flex container’s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.

.container {
  align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | stretch | start | end | baseline | first baseline | last baseline + ... safe | unsafe;
}

    normal (default): items are packed in their default position as if no value was set.
    flex-start / start: items packed to the start of the container. The (more supported) flex-start honors the flex-direction while start honors the writing-mode direction.
    flex-end / end: items packed to the end of the container. The (more support) flex-end honors the flex-direction while end honors the writing-mode direction.
    center: items centered in the container
    space-between: items evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end
    space-around: items evenly distributed with equal space around each line
    space-evenly: items are evenly distributed with equal space around them
    stretch: lines stretch to take up the remaining space

The safe and unsafe modifier keywords can be used in conjunction with all the rest of these keywords (although note browser support), and deal with helping you prevent aligning elements such that the content becomes inaccessible.

______________________________________________________
CHILDREN:
______________________________________________________

order:
By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.

.item {
  order: 5; /* default is 0 */
}
____________________________________


flex-grow:
This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.

If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the others (or it will try to, at least).

.item {
  flex-grow: 4; /* default 0 */
}

Negative numbers are invalid.
____________________________________

flex-shrink:
This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.

.item {
  flex-shrink: 3; /* default 1 */
}

Negative numbers are invalid.

____________________________________

flex-basis:
This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The auto keyword means “look at my width or height property” (which was temporarily done by the main-size keyword until deprecated). The content keyword means “size it based on the item’s content” – this keyword isn’t well supported yet, so it’s hard to test and harder to know what its brethren max-content, min-content, and fit-content do.

.item {
  flex-basis:  | auto; /* default auto */
}

If set to 0, the extra space around content isn’t factored in. If set to auto, the extra space is distributed based on its flex-grow value. See this graphic.

____________________________________

flex:
This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional. The default is 0 1 auto, but if you set it with a single number value, it’s like 1 0.

.item {
  flex: none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ]
}

It is recommended that you use this shorthand property rather than set the individual properties. The shorthand sets the other values intelligently.

____________________________________

align-self:
This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items.

Please see the align-items explanation to understand the available values.

.item {
  align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
}

Note that float, clear and vertical-align have no effect on a flex item.
